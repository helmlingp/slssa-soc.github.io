## Purpose

To outline the procedure for ensuring public safety during positioning, launching, and beaching of SLS vessels on beaches.

## Overview

SLSSA requires additional safety considerations when launching and beaching SLS rescue vessels.

## Procedure

SLS rescue vessels could pose a hazard due to their size, weight, speed, and a combination thereof. Launching and beaching creates a situation where the vessel may have a lowered level of control.

Vessels must be positioned on the beach in ‘standby’ and should launch and beach within pre-determined designated areas signposted by specific ‘Rescue Craft Access Area’ hazards signs.

Drivers/operators/skippers must ensure the beach area and immediate water area is clear of patrons prior to launching or beaching the vessel.

In emergency situations, SLS rescue vessels may be exempted from this requirement but must ensure risk is minimised to any in-water patrons as best able/appropriate.
