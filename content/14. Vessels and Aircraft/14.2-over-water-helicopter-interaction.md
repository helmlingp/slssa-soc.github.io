## Purpose

To outline the procedure for lifesaving services to interact with a helicopter over water.

## Overview

When coordinating operations with a helicopter over water, watercraft should be strategically positioned to facilitate safe and efficient procedures.

This SOP outlines the procedures for coordinating with a helicopter during water-based operations.

## Procedure

When dealing with the helicopter on water, watercraft should be positioned at the 2 o’clock position. If safe to do so, RWC should face away from the incoming Helicopter so that the sled is exposed for an unobstructed winch operation.

An IRB driver should attempt to face the incoming helicopter and position themselves so the helicopter approaches from the 2 o’clock angle.

All watercraft should take direction from Air Crew via Channel 3 where possible. Watch for hand signals when the helicopter is in close range and radio is not available.
