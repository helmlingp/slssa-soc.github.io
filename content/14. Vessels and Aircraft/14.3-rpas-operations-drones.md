## Purpose

To outline the procedure for Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS), also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones.

## Overview

The Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) Service is a state-level asset authorised to operate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) specifically for lifesaving purposes. This capability is centrally managed to ensure safety, compliance, and coordination across all lifesaving operations.

Under no circumstances is it permitted for an individual, SLSC, or any other service to operate a Remotely Piloted Aircraft for lifesaving purposes outside of the official RPAS Service. This strict regulation ensures that all aerial operations are conducted under the appropriate protocols and oversight, maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of lifesaving efforts across the state.
