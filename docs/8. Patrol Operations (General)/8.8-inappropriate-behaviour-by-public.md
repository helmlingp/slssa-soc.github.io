# 8.8 Inappropriate Behaviour by Public

## Purpose

To outline the protocols for managing inappropriate behaviour by members of the public.

## Overview

Inappropriate behaviour covers numerous activities that occur on beaches defined by relevant legislation.

## Procedure

Where a patron reports someone to SLS personnel, or SLS personnel observe someone involved in offensive inappropriate behaviour or they believe someone to be suspicious they should follow the procedures listed below:

- Maintain a safe distance.
- If possible, keep members of the public away (i.e. restrict access to area of beach or public toilets etc).
- Make note of the personâ€™s description, location and vehicle.
- Take notes from witnesses.
- Contact the SOC for Police assistance.
- Where Police are not on-site, SLS personnel (minimum of 2) should observe the suspect (if safe to do so) and remain in contact with their patrol base until the Police arrive.
- Water safety should not be compromised in this situation and minimum lifesaving service standards should be maintained in regard to water surveillance/patrolled area.
