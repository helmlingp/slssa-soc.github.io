# 15.2 Critical Incident Debriefing

## Purpose

To outline the procedures and processes for ensuring a consistent and structured delivery of operational debriefs following a critical incident.

## Procedure

### Why should an operational debrief be undertaken following a Critical Incident?

An operational debrief following a critical incident is essential for several reasons:

1. **Documenting Environmental Conditions and Incident Details**: It allows for the accurate documentation of environmental conditions and ensures that all parties have a shared understanding of the nature and circumstances of the incident.
2. **Reinforcing Effective Actions**: By highlighting what was done well during the incident, the debrief reinforces positive actions and strategies, ensuring that successful practices are recognised and can be replicated in future operations.
3. **Identifying Areas for Improvement**: The debrief provides a platform to discuss and analyse areas where performance could have been improved. This feedback is vital for suggesting changes to local beach tactics or patrol operations, enhancing overall safety and efficiency.
4. **Supporting Member Welfare**: The debrief serves as a precursor to discussions on the support options available to members involved in the incident. This includes mental health and welfare considerations, as outlined in [SOP 15.3 – Member Welfare – Critical Incidents](#_15.3_Member_Welfare). Addressing these needs is crucial for ensuring the well-being of all personnel.

Undertaking a thorough operational debrief is not only about reviewing the incident but also about fostering a culture of continuous improvement and support within the organisation.

### What incidents require an operational debrief?

If a Duty Officer attends the scene of a Critical Incident, their presence and participation in the subsequent operational debrief are compulsory. During the debrief, the Duty Officer is expected to facilitate a comprehensive and constructive review. Examples of when a Duty Officer may be required to conduct an operational debrief include:

- Incidents involving death of a patient, CPR or drowning.
- Shark attack.
- A member of SLS is seriously injured.
- Severe asthma attack / anaphylactic reaction.
- Major injury with hospitalisation.
- Major or complex rescue.
- Severe trauma.
- Abuse or aggressive behaviour by members of the public.

### When/where should the operational debrief be undertaken?

An operational debrief is typically conducted immediately after the conclusion of a Critical Incident. This timing ensures that the most accurate recollections and information are captured and allows members to receive timely information about welfare and support services.

The debrief should be held in a private, secure location, free from media or public interference. It is ideal for the location to be secluded with no thoroughfare, and to be equipped with a whiteboard or notepaper for recording feedback, as well as chairs, tables, and water for participants. A Surf Life Saving Club facility often meets these requirements effectively.

Whenever possible, the debrief should be conducted using the debrief template at [www.surflifesavingsa.com.au/debrief](http://www.surflifesavingsa.com.au/debrief). If the debrief template cannot be accessed, then notes must be taken and forwarded to the State Operations Centre to be included with the incident log.

### Who should deliver/lead the operational debrief?

The most appropriate person, usually a Duty Officer, should lead every operational debrief following a critical incident as part of the incident Recovery Phase. If a Duty Officer is not available an appropriate state representative (e.g. non-rostered Duty Officer, State Officer or staff member) should be tasked to deliver the debrief.

### Who should attend?

All SLS personnel who were involved in the incident, whether on scene or not (i.e. State Operations Centre operators and SLSC management involved in coordination of resources etc) should attend, regardless of the level of involvement. Any personnel not in attendance should be recorded in the debrief form and followed up by the Lifesaving Department.

### What information needs to be recorded and retained?

Debrief notes must be completed and provided to the SOC.

If the incident occurred on patrol, the SOC Supervisor must notify the Patrol Captain or Duty Officer the Incident Log has been closed as is ready for incident details to be updated.

In certain circumstances, the completion of Member Statement Forms may be requested by the SOC or Duty Officer.

Member injuries must be reported to the SOC.
