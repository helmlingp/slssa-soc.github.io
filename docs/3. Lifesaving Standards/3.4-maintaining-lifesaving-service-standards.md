# 3.4 Maintaining Lifesaving Service Standards

## Purpose

To outline the framework regarding delivery, compliance checks, and issue resolution for SLS services.

## Overview

As providers of key public safety services, SLSSA has established in partnership with its membership, state/local government, emergency service partners and the public, minimum service expectations.

Ensuring it meets its minimum obligations is fundamental to SLS from a public safety, member safety and credibility perspective.

All active patrolling members/clubs/services have an obligation to ensure individual and club/service minimum

standards are reached and maintained consistently.

Refer to [SLSSA By-Laws](https://www.surflifesavingsa.com.au/s/The-By-Laws-Feb-2024.pdf).

## Procedure Framework

The following programs/initiatives complement each other and facilitate clear expectations and ongoing quality assurance measures at SLSC and state levels:

- Lifesaving Service Agreements,
- SLSSA Standard Operating Procedures, and
- Annual Gear and Equipment Inspections.

### Not Meeting Minimum Standards

If a SLSC is found not to be meeting its minimum standards, the Lifesaving Department will investigate.

Ongoing challenges with meeting minimum standards must be referred to the Lifesaving Advisory Committee.
