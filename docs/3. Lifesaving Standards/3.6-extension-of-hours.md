# 3.6 Extension of Hours

## Purpose

To provide guidance for SLS services in extending their operational hours past their minimum finish time.

### Overview

Lifesaving service times are allocated based on a risk management approach which considers lifesaving operations, weather, time of year, beach visitors and the like. However, these times are a minimum and may need to be extended depending on the conditions on the day (i.e. a very hot day in October may cause the public to remain longer at the beach in the afternoon).

### Procedure

When a SLS service is due to finish its operations the Patrol Captain/Senior Lifeguard should assess the level of risk present.

Given this risk assessment it may be deemed a ‘high risk’ to close the patrolled area and go ‘off-duty’ and thus the need to extend services may be warranted. If this is the case the following should occur:

1. The Patrol Captain/Senior Lifeguard is to consult team member/s to discuss extension of hours and requirement to meet minimum lifesaving standards to do so,
2. The State Operations Centre (SOC) must be contacted and informed of the situation at least 30 minutes prior to the end of patrol, and
3. Relevant Emergency Operations Group (EOG) services are considered to assist (e.g. RWCs) to either complement or substitute the patrol.

If extended hours are agreed:

1. Minimum lifesaving standards are required for the continuation of a patrol (including the number of Bronze Medallion holders, equipment etc),
2. The lifesaving service is to continue operations and monitor/evaluate every half an hour until making a decision to complete operations, and
3. The SOC will continue to function until the last patrol has closed for the day.
