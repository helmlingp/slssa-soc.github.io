# 9.12 Aircraft Crash

## Purpose

To outline how SLSSA may support SA Police (SAPOL) response operations in the event of an aircraft accident and provide guidelines and special consideration for SLSSA personnel responding to an aircraft crash incident

## Overview

Lifesaving services may be requested to assist following an aircraft crash event along the SA coastline.

SAPOL is the Control Agency for aircraft accident response operations.

SLSSA may be tasked by the SAPOL, through the Surf Emergency Response System (13 SURF).

Lifesaving service response to an aircraft crash incident aligns with standard SLSA training relating to in-water search & rescue and/or land based first aid treatment and emergency care.

The possible number of injured or lost patients requires the response of a significant quantity of lifesaving resources, rescue helicopters, Ambulance, Fire and Police resources as soon as possible.

### Personal Safety

Aircraft crash incidents can pose hazards to lifesaving services that require specific consideration, such as:

- Fuel
- Fire/smoke/gas hazards
- Sharps (glass/metal)

## Procedure

Any response to an aircraft incident should be conducted under the direction of SAPOL through the State Operations Centre (in consultation with the Primary Rostered Duty Officer).

Types of Aircraft Accidents:

- **Land emergency:** Where an aircraft makes an emergency landing on land.
- **Water emergency:** Where an aircraft makes an emergency landing on.

In the event of a plane crash on the beach, SLSC should follow these critical steps to ensure safety and coordinate an effective response:

1. Activate Emergency Protocols

- **Alert Emergency Services:** Immediately notify emergency services by calling 000 to report the crash and request urgent assistance. Provide detailed information including the location, number of people involved, and any known hazards.
- **Inform the State Operations Centre (SOC):** Contact the SOC to report the incident and receive further instructions. The SOC will coordinate additional resources and support.

1. Ensure Safety

- **Secure the Area:** Establish a safety perimeter around the crash site to prevent unauthorised access and protect bystanders from potential hazards, such as fire, debris, or hazardous materials.
- **Evacuate and Assist:** Evacuate nearby beachgoers and ensure they are safely away from the crash site. Provide first aid and support to any survivors or injured individuals if it is safe to do so.

1. Coordinate with Emergency Responders

- **Provide Support:** Assist emergency responders upon their arrival by providing information about the crash site, any known hazards, and the status of individuals involved.
- **Follow Instructions:** Adhere to the directions provided by emergency services and SOC personnel. This may include helping with evacuation, managing crowds, or assisting with the identification of survivors.

### Site Marking

The submersion of an aircraft may require lifesaving services to mark the location via the use of buoys etc. Interpretation of currents and drift may be required to identify search areas. Marker dye may be suitable for such.

### Triage Centres

Lifesaving services personnel may be requested to assist with the establishment of a triage treatment centre either within a SLSC and or adjacent areas.

### Evacuation

An aircraft must only be evacuated once it is stationary. It is important to move passengers well away and upwind after evacuating the aircraft.

### Aircraft Crashes into Water

When an aircraft crashes into the water, the impact is likely to cause the aircraft to break up in pieces. Although the risk of fire is reduced fuel floating on the surface of the water can ignite spontaneously. When the aircraft is floating after a crash care should be taken to ensure buoyancy is not disturbed. Survivors should be evacuated smoothly and quickly before the aircraft begins to fill and sink. If there is some time before the aircraft sinks divers can sometimes rescue persons trapped in the air pockets within the fuselage. Lifesaving personnel must prioritise their personal safety at all times andmust not attempt to enter an aircraft that has crashed.

### Aircraft Crashes onto Land

When an aircraft crashes onto land there may be several impacts before the aircraft becomes stationary. There is a very high risk of smoke, fire and explosions post-crash and persons may become trapped inside the aircraft. Lifesaving personnel must prioritise their personal safety at all times and must not attempt to enter an aircraft that has crashed.

### Precautions When Dealing With Crashed Aircraft

Although the risk of igniting fuel on the water surface is low, every precaution should be taken to prevent such an event. This may even include turning off the motors to prevent any possibility of ignition. If crew members are required to enter the water, personal safety is paramount. They should be protected against the effects of the fuel by wearing appropriate protective gear, including a wetsuit, helmet, and a mask/goggles. Fuel exposure can irritate the skin and mucus membranes. Special care should be taken when women enter fuel-contaminated water due to heightened exposure risks. If possible, When the crew re-boards the boat they should be thoroughly washed down with fresh water and then shower as soon as possible. Wetsuits should also be thoroughly cleaned to prevent damage. Always follow the decontamination procedure as directed by the control agency.
