## Purpose

To ensure that all SLS personnel using defibrillator equipment are properly trained and qualified, and that all defibrillator equipment meets SLSA standards.

## Overview

All SLS personnel required to use defibrillator equipment should be appropriately trained and qualified.

All defibrillator equipment must meet SLSA standards.

## Procedure

### Deployment

All Surf Rescue Awards – including Provide First Aid – require SLSSA personnel to be trained, and maintain competency, in the use of an AED.

All SLSCs must maintain at least one operational AED at all times.

Due to the nature of cardiac arrest and the importance of “time to first shock” it is necessary that the AED is located with other first response equipment (on/in rescue vehicle etc.) or at a common accessible location (patrol tent etc).

### Equipment

An AED Kit must contain the following items as a minimum:

- AED (SLSA Endorsed) and AED Pads
- Pen and paper
- Small towel (for drying chest)
- Clothing shears (for cutting heavy clothing/wetsuits)
- Disposable razor
- Disposable gloves and resuscitation mask
- Water-resistant carry case (waterproof pelican-type case preferred)
