## Purpose

To provide an overview of the local prowords and radio procedures in SA.

## Overview

To align SLSSA procedures with other agencies to increase interoperability, improve efficiency, reduce the amount of air occupied by messages, make communications during incidents more efficient and create consistency during multi agency rescue.

## Procedure

| **Proword** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| **Send**<br><br>_Used by all agencies_ | **Meaning** – Send your message (e.g. Glenelg Send) |
| **More to follow**<br><br>_Used by all agencies_ | **Meaning** \- indicates a pause in transmission to allow the other station to confirm they are ready to receive more information<br><br>_SURFCOM – Report of a 5m shark sighting at your beach,_ **_more to follow_**<br><br>_SURF CLUB – Roger, send_<br><br>_SURFCOM – Shark sighting is 100m off shore, 100m north of jetty_ |
| **Over** | **May be omitted at the end of a transmission.**<br><br>The digital network has a beep at the end of all transmissions to indicate a transmission has finished. |
| **Out** | **May be omitted at the end of a transmission.**<br><br>The digital network makes it clear a channel is occupied and natural language makes it clear when a conversation is complete.<br><br>May still be used if the circumstances require it (e.g. extended transmissions).<br><br>Will not be used by other agencies using SLSSA channels which may<br><br>cause confusion. No longer used by some interstate lifesaving services. |
