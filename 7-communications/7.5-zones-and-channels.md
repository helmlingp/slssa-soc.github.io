## Purpose

To ensure a consistent and standardised form of communication across SA, zones and channels are used for all radio communications.

## Procedure

All SLS radios used by SLSSA use the following zone and channel assignment.

### Zones

A zone is a collection of channels.

- **Zone A –** Normal patrol operations and includes the main channels used by SLS services
- **Zone B –** Manual selection of a repeater channel, usually only used at the direction of the State Operations Centre for troubleshooting
- **Zone C –** Surf Sports

Zone A is recommended for all SLSCs and services.

\*Limited to some Surf Sports radios

### Channel Priority

The channels in Zones A and B are primarily for SLS operations. If there are no SLS operations occurring on the channels in these zones, they may be used for training in accordance with SOP 6.5 – Radio Training.

### Temporary Change to Channel Usage in Chiton Rocks and Normanville Areas

In the Chiton Rocks and Normanville areas, Zone A – Channel 2 must be used as the main patrol channel.
