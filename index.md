Welcome to the Surf Life Saving SA (SLSSA) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This document serves as the cornerstone of our operational framework, outlining essential protocols and best practices designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of our Surf Life Saving operations. The SOPs provide a structured approach to managing both routine and emergency situations and are vital for maintaining the high standards of safety, professionalism, and preparedness that are central to our mission.

SLSSA is dedicated to protecting lives on South Australia’s beaches through a combination of preventative actions and emergency response services. As an organisation, we recognise that the dynamic nature of the ocean and the varied conditions we encounter require a flexible yet standardised approach to our operations. The procedures outlined in this manual are based on current best practices, legal requirements, and the latest research, ensuring that our volunteers and staff are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to respond effectively to any situation.

The SOPs are designed to be comprehensive and user-friendly, providing clear and concise guidelines for all aspects of Surf Life Saving duties. From routine patrols and rescue operations to first aid and communication protocols, this manual addresses the critical elements of our work. Each procedure has been carefully crafted to align with both national and international standards, reflecting our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.

In addition to outlining specific procedures, this manual emphasises the importance of teamwork, training, and adherence to safety protocols. Effective Surf Life Saving requires coordination and collaboration among all team members, and the SOPs reinforce the principles of mutual support and respect. By adhering to these procedures, our personnel can perform their roles with confidence and ensure a cohesive and efficient response to any challenges that arise.

As you navigate through this document, we encourage you to familiarise yourself with the content and integrate these procedures into your daily practices. Your adherence to these SOPs is crucial for maintaining the high standards of safety and professionalism that define Surf Life Saving SA. Together, we can continue to uphold our commitment to safeguarding lives and enhancing the safety of our community on the shores of South Australia.

## Contributions

This document was developed through the dedicated efforts of volunteers from the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Working Group, a subcommittee of the Lifesaving Advisory Committee. These volunteers, including the State Officer (Aerial Services), State Officer (Communications), State Officer (Powercraft), State Medical Advisor, Lifesaving and Emergency Operations Coordinator, and four general members, each with experience in Surf Life Saving, emergency management, or related fields, worked collaboratively to make recommendations and assist in the creation of SOPs for Surf Life Saving SA’s operational areas. Surf Life Saving SA recognises and values the significant contributions of these members.

Surf Life Saving SA acknowledges the kind support of Surf Life Saving NSW to develop the SLSSA Standard Operating Procedures.
